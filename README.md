# SillyTavern Extension theHandy

Provides control of theHandy to your favorite LLM

## Features

1: Controls theHandy
2: Bakes cake
3: ???

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Put the url of this github repo into sillytavern's installer.

### Usage

You need to specify to the LLM how to use this device, and convince it to also use it.
See https://github.com/NodudeWasTaken/st-extension-thehandy/blob/master/command.md for an attempt at instructing the LLM to use it.
Commanding the LLM is still a WIP, as i haven't been able to make it use the commands consistently.


See https://github.com/NodudeWasTaken/st-extension-thehandy/blob/master/theHandy.json for a "world" import.
